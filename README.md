# wz_wireframe_kit_sketch
Draw wireframes quickly and easily. Bring convenience to your work!

## What's this?
`wz_wireframe_kit.sketch` contains lots of elements you can use in your wireframes files.

I have seen and used lots of wireframe kits. Though they are all beautiful enough, they are not friendly to others. They have no explanations telling how the app works. So I designed `wz_wireframe_kit.sketch` and hope it could be friendly to designers, product managers and engineers, making wireframe a useful tool for communication.
